# Hi, I'm Kaleb :tiger:

## What I do
I am a software engineer currently working with full stack applications using modern web and native technoligies including React, React Native, .NET, Entity Framework, PostgreSQL, and AWS. I also work with Python, WPF, and Java for non-web projects.

## What I enjoy
I enjoy starting applications with a vision and watching them come to life through software engineering processes. I also enjoy creating user-friendly applications and solving challenging problems.

Besides what you can see in my repositories, below are some images of projects I have worked on previously.
